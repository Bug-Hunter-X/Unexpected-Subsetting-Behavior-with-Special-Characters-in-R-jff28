```R
# Robust subsetting that handles special characters and potential errors
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("a", "b", "c"), col2 = c(1, 2, 3))
# Use the correct column names directly instead of relying on character vector with special characters
subset_df <- df[, c("col1", "col2")]
#If you absolutely need to use a character vector, make sure you use it with `[` and then specify the column indices
column_names <- c("col1", "col2")
subset_df <- df[, column_names]
#Alternative approach using dplyr
library(dplyr)
subset_df <- select(df, col1, col2)
```
